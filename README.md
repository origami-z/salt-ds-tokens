Visualize Salt Design System design tokens: https://origami-z.github.io/salt-ds-tokens/.

By default, tokens are loaded from a local copy ([`salt-ds.ts`](https://github.com/origami-z/salt-ds-tokens/blob/main/docs/visualizer/src/controllers/salt-data.ts)).
Alternatively, different set of data can be loaded from remote URL via URL param `remoteJsonUrl`, e.g. from a PR - Sample [Salt Theme Next token structure](https://origami-z.github.io/salt-ds-tokens/?filter=light%2Cmedium&remoteJsonUrl=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fjpmorganchase%252Fsalt-ds%252Fcae97dfe8b05fb91baef578f8ca04b25315fdc5e%252Fpackages%252Ftheme%252Fjson%252Ftheme.json&token=palette%2Cneutral) from [Salt#3143](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/pull/3143).

Note: for [Spectrum 2](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com/) token data has been graduated to the `main` branch. If you need access to the S1 data, use the [`s1-legacy` branch](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data/tree/s1-legacy) and `v12.x.x` packages on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/spectrum-tokens?activeTab=versions).

The [Spectrum token visualizer](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/visualizer/) shows the token data for S1. For Spectrum 2 data, use [opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/s2-visualizer/](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-design-data/s2-visualizer/).
